**Description and links of datasets:** 

  - City owned properties: This data contains city-owned properties from the eProperties Plus database. The data describe basic aspects of the property (square footage, 
    location, identification, etc.) and its geographically based assignment of various components of city infrastructure (police zone, council district, etc.). This 
    data is used in identifying properties that are unused throughout the city. This was chosen becuase more public properties for people to use and access makes for a 
    better area. (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-owned-properties)
    
  - Trees: Trees cared for and managed by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works Forestry Division. This was chosen since more trees generally makes for a 
    prettier and more natural space. (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees)
    
  - Speed Bumps (ava): Speed humps installed by the City of Pittsburgh to slow down traffic. This was chosen since an area with more speed bumbs means less worry of speeding 
    drivers when walking around. (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-speed-humps)
